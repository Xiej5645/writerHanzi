# writerHanzi

Built with **ReactJS + Vite** aimed at helping students practice writing Chinese (traditional and simplified) using the proper stroke order. 

While I studied Chinese, stroke order was hard to remember and only few resources online to practice writing Chinese characters. Most apps that do provide stroke order practice feature were limited or paid, thus I started this side project as a computer science student. 

Open to collaborations and contributions. Thank you for visiting this repo.   
Have ideas for how writerHanzi can be improved? Feel free to open an issue or a pull request!
